# SCC MSc Dissertation Template
## School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University

This MSc template was created by Lewis Newsham. It is adapted from the SCC PhD template created by Andrew Moore and Alistair Baron with help from Paul Rayson, and Edward Dearden.

Conforms with Lancaster University [Manual of Academic Regulations and Procedures (MARP) 2022-23 for Postgraduate Research](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGR-Regs.pdf). For layout information the most relevant pages of that document are pages 30-32 (Appendix 2).

Note: Appendix 2 within MARP 2022-23 sets out the prescribed form for the submission for examination, and the deposit of the final version of research theses at Lancaster University. In the case of dissertations submitted as part of a taught Masters programme (which includes the MRes), the presentation of submissions shall be subject to guidance prepared by the relevant Faculty/Department.

## Important Information for Taught Masters Programmes (Cyber Security & Data Science)

As stated, the rules set out within MARP 2022-23 apply to theses submitted for all doctoral degrees, the MPhil degree and the LLM/MA/MSc by Research degrees. They do not apply to dissertations submitted as part of a taught Masters programme (which includes the MRes). Students registered on taught Masters programmes are therefore advised to seek early advice from their department on departmental requirements for the presentations of dissertations. Requirements in this regard may relate to page and font sizing, margins, line spacing etc.

If there are no departmental requirements for the presentation of dissertations for a given academic year, and if no requirements have been explicitly stated, then students are permitted to adhere to the rules set out within MARP 2022-23 if they wish, as these are generally accepted guidelines for the presentation of theses for completion within various degrees, in a University-wide scope.

If you are still unsure regarding how to format and present your dissertation, consult your programme director or academic supervisor for further guidance. It is not within the scope of this document to comprehensively outline various approaches toward the presentation of the dissertation.
